# Book-Engine-Search-HW21

## Description

Aside from this being the challenge to practice our skills with MERN, anyone is able to use this app to search for books through the Google Books API. All one has to do is type into the search bar to find books, and the title, author, description, and several other details will be displayed. Should a user wish to save some books for later viewing, they would need to create an account/log in.

## Installation

1. First, clone this code into your repository.
2. Second, install the necessary dependencies (npm i).
3. Third, run the server with npm run develop.

## Deployed App

Below is a link to the deployed app, via Heroku: https://ancient-shore-40297.herokuapp.com/. 

## Usage

In theory, someone who wishes to browse books via Google would use this. They could search for different books and store that information for later, should they have an account.

## Contributions

Aside from my instructor and TA, the support at AskBCS helped by adding a fresh pair of eyes when I was looking for small mistakes. In addition, my tutor helped me get started with this assignment and understand where to start.
